# ETH-Price-Prediction
This project seeks to predict the price of ETH based on historical ETH prices and Ethereum blockchain data such as gas usage.

The dataset for this project includes the last 7 years (from Friday, August 7, 2015 12:00:00 AM (GMT)
to Sunday, November 13, 2022 12:00:00 AM (GMT)) of the following: the Ethereum blockchain’s
average gas limit, average gas price, network transaction fee, and total gas used; and ETH’s market
capitalization and price.

90% of the data will be used for the training set, and 10% will be used for the validation set. The
most recent data will be used in the validation set, as predicting prices in the present is the goal. This
dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aniketkolte04/eth-blockchain-data).
